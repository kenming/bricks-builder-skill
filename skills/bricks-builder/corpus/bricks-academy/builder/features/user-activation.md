Starting with **Bricks 2.1**, you can enable **User activation** for WordPress registrations. Once enabled, newly registered users receive an activation email and must click the activation link before they can log in.

:::note
**IMPORTANT: This feature applies to all new user registrations, not just those submitted via the Form element.**
:::

## Quick overview {#quick-overview}

Here is a step-by-step overview of how this feature works once it's enabled.

1. A new user account is created.
2. Bricks stores a generated activation key and marks the user as **pending**.
3. Bricks sends the activation email to the new user's email address.
4. The activation link points to the configured **Verification success page** with `user_id` and `activation_key` query parameters.
5. When the user opens that valid link, Bricks deletes the activation key and marks the user as **active**.
6. If **Auto login after activation** is enabled, Bricks logs the user in after successful activation.
7. If the activation link is invalid, Bricks redirects the user to the configured **Verification failure page**.
8. Pending users cannot log in. Bricks returns an inactive-account login error.

Users created before User activation was enabled do not have activation status meta. Bricks treats them as active.

## Configuration and controls {#configuration-and-controls}

Inside the WordPress dashboard, go to **Bricks > Settings > General** and scroll to **User activation**.

**User activation**: Enable this to require new users to verify their email after registration. After enabling it, the rest of the settings become available.

:::note
When User activation is enabled, the Form element's registration **Auto log in user** setting is not available. Use **Auto login after activation** instead.
:::

**Auto login after activation**: Automatically logs the user in after successful email verification.

**Verification success page**: The page used for successful activation links. Bricks expects the activation link to point to this page. If the user opens this page without `user_id` and `activation_key`, Bricks simply renders the page normally.

**Verification failure page**: The page users are redirected to when activation fails because the user ID or activation key is missing or invalid.

**User activation: Email**:

- **From email address**: Optional sender email. If empty, WordPress' normal `wp_mail_from` value is used.
- **From name**: Optional sender name. If empty, WordPress' normal `wp_mail_from_name` value is used.
- **Subject**: Email subject. If empty, Bricks uses "Activate your account".
- **Email content**: Email body. If empty, Bricks sends a default activation message.
- **HTML email**: Sends the email as HTML. If enabled and the content is not a full HTML document, Bricks converts line breaks with `nl2br()`.

Available email placeholders:

| Placeholder | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `{{site_name}}` | Site name |
| `{{site_tagline}}` | Site tagline |
| `{{site_url}}` | Site URL |
| `{{username}}` | User login |
| `{{user_display_name}}` | User display name |
| `{{user_first_name}}` | User first name |
| `{{user_last_name}}` | User last name |
| `{{user_email}}` | User email |
| `{{activation_link}}` | Activation URL, or an HTML link when HTML email is enabled |
| `{{activation_url}}` | Plain activation URL |

## Registration behavior

User activation hooks into WordPress' `user_register` flow while the feature is enabled. This means it affects:

- Users registered through the Bricks Form element.
- Users registered through other WordPress registration flows that trigger `user_register`.

For Bricks Form element registrations:

- The registration action still validates username, email, password, password length, and role.
- Administrator and Super Admin roles are blocked as registration targets for security.
- If the username is not mapped, Bricks can generate it from the email address.
- If the password is not mapped or submitted, Bricks can generate one.
- Auto-login after registration is skipped while User activation is enabled.

If **Send WordPress notification** is enabled in the registration form action, Bricks triggers WordPress' `register_new_user` action after creating the user. The activation email is still sent by the User activation feature.

## Activation link behavior

The activation URL is built from your configured **Verification success page** plus two query parameters:

```text
?user_id=123&activation_key=generated_key
```

When the request reaches the success page, Bricks checks those parameters:

- Missing `user_id` or `activation_key`: the success page renders normally.
- Empty `user_id` or `activation_key`: the user is redirected to the failure page.
- Invalid activation key: the user is redirected to the failure page.
- Valid activation key: the account is marked active and the activation key is deleted.
- Already active user: Bricks skips activation and renders the success page normally.

Both the success page and failure page should be published pages.

## Users page {#users-page}

A new **Activation status** column appears on the WordPress **Users** page.

![](imgs/bricks-user-activation-admin-column-6b6e420848.png)

Possible statuses:

- **Active**: user can log in normally.
- **Inactive**: user has pending activation status and cannot log in until activated.

For each user, you can perform different actions based on their activation status by hovering over the user entry:

For an **active** user, **Mark as inactive** prevents the user from logging in.

For an **inactive** user, **Resend activation email** sends a new activation link using the current email template, and **Mark as active** manually marks the user as active without email verification.

Only users with the WordPress `edit_users` capability can change activation status or resend activation emails from the Users screen.

## Login behavior

When a pending user tries to log in, Bricks blocks authentication and shows an inactive-account error. Users with `active` status, and users with no activation status from before the feature was enabled, can log in normally.

If you also use [Custom Authentication Pages](/builder/features/custom-authentication-pages/), the same activation check applies to the Bricks **User login** form action because it uses WordPress authentication.

## Email customization filters

The email settings can also be adjusted programmatically:

- `bricks/user_activation_email/from_name`
- `bricks/user_activation_email/subject`
- `bricks/user_activation_email/content`

These filters are useful for multilingual sites or projects that need different email text per user or context.
