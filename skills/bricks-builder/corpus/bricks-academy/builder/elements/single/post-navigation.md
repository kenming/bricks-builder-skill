Displays navigation links to previous and next posts.

The element uses WordPress adjacent-post navigation. **Previous** points to the previous post according to WordPress's post-date order, and **Next** points to the next one. This can look reversed when visitors arrive from a posts list sorted by date in descending order.

## Settings

- **Direction** (direction) - Layout direction for navigation items.
- **Max. post width** (number) - Maximum width for post navigation items.
- **In same term** (checkbox) - Navigate within same taxonomy term.
- **Excluded terms** (select) - Terms to exclude from navigation.
- **Taxonomy** (select) - Taxonomy for same term navigation. Default: category.

### Label
- **Show label** (checkbox) - Display navigation labels. Default: true.
- **Prev label** (text) - Label for previous post. Default: "Previous post".
- **Next label** (text) - Label for next post. Default: "Next post".
- **Label typography** (typography) - Typography for navigation labels.

### Title
- **Show title** (checkbox) - Display post titles in navigation. Default: true.
- **Title tag** (text) - HTML tag for post titles. Default: h5.
- **Title typography** (typography) - Typography for post titles.
- **Alignment: Previous post** (justify-content) - Alignment for previous post section.
- **Alignment: Next post** (justify-content) - Alignment for next post section.

### Arrows
- **Prev arrow** (icon) - Icon for previous post navigation.
- **Next arrow** (icon) - Icon for next post navigation.
- **Typography** (typography) - Typography for arrow icons.

You can change the labels and arrows to match the wording used by your design. The element does not include a setting that reverses the underlying adjacent-post lookup. Changing that order requires custom PHP through WordPress's adjacent-post filters, or a custom navigation implementation.

### Image
- **Show image** (checkbox) - Display post featured images. Default: true.
- **Size** (select) - WordPress image size. Default: Thumbnail.
- **Height** (number) - Image height. Default: 60px.
- **Width** (number) - Image width. Default: 60px.
- **Border** (border) - Image border settings.
