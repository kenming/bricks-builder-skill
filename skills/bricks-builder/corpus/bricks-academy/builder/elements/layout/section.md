The Section element allows you to structure/divide your page into self-containing areas (think: one topic per section).

The [Understanding the Layout](/builder/styling/layout/) article covers in more detail how to best use the layout elements in Bricks.

The Section element is the outermost building block for structuring and dividing your page. Use sections to separate and space out individual parts of your page, such as hero sections, content areas, or footers.

The Section element has a default width of 100%, uses the `section` tag, and flexbox. Sections take up 100% of the available width and adjust in height according to their content. They are stacked vertically on top of each other.

It should be used at the root level to structure your page into self-containing areas. When adding a Section to the canvas, a Container element is added inside of the Section automatically. You can delete this Container if not needed. It's just the default behaviour to speed up your site creation process.
