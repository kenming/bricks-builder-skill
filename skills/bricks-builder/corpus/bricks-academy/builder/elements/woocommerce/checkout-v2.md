Displays the WooCommerce checkout page as editable Checkout, Login required, Pay, Thank you, and Order receipt states.

:::note
This element requires **Bricks > Settings > WooCommerce > Enable advanced modular elements**.
:::

## Where this element works

Checkout page.

## Key settings

- **State** (radio) - Switches the builder preview between checkout states.

## States

- **Checkout** - Customer details, order summary, payment options, and place order layout.
- **Login required** - Login screen shown when WooCommerce requires login before an order-related checkout screen.
- **Pay** - Payment screen for unpaid orders.
- **Thank you** - Order confirmation screen after checkout.
- **Order receipt** - Receipt screen for unpaid order links that no longer need payment.

## Generated structures

The Checkout state can generate these structures:

- **Complete checkout**
- **Billing fields**
- **Shipping fields**
- **Payment options**
- **Additional fields**
- **Order summary**
- **Place order**

When **Complete checkout** is selected, **Generate as multistep** creates a ready-made multistep checkout layout.

The **Billing fields** and **Complete checkout** structures also generate the account credential fields currently required by WooCommerce. Bricks places these fields inside a **Checkout account fields** wrapper so WooCommerce's account-creation settings control their frontend visibility.

The Login required, Pay, Thank you, and Order receipt states each provide a complete block for that state.

:::note
Some Checkout v2 support elements, including generated form fields, checkout steps, step navigation items, payment options, and place order sections, rely on the correct Checkout v2 state context. If you cannot find a support element in the regular Elements panel, use **Insert a structure** and then edit the generated element in the Structure panel.

## Account creation during checkout

Checkout v2 follows the guest checkout and account creation settings under **WooCommerce > Settings > Accounts & Privacy**.

| Guest checkout | Account creation during checkout | Checkout behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enabled | Disabled | Guests can check out without account fields. |
| Enabled | Enabled | Guests can select **Create an account?** to reveal the required account fields. |
| Disabled | Enabled | Account creation is required. The account fields remain visible without the optional **Create an account?** checkbox. |
| Disabled | Disabled | Logged-out customers see the Checkout v2 **Login required** state. |

WooCommerce decides which credential fields are required:

| Generate account login | Send password setup link | Credential fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enabled | Enabled | None |
| Disabled | Enabled | Username |
| Enabled | Disabled | Password |
| Disabled | Disabled | Username and password |

Generated username and password fields are required. Bricks reads these fields from WooCommerce's current checkout field registry, including fields added by third-party plugins, instead of assuming a fixed set.

The **Allow customers to create an account on the My Account page** setting applies to Account Page v2 registration and does not change account creation during Checkout v2.

## Multistep checkout

Use [Checkout v2 multistep checkout](/integrations/woocommerce/multistep-checkout-v2/) when you want the Checkout state split into multiple steps.

You can create the multistep layout with the [Woo Setup Wizard](/integrations/woocommerce/woo-setup-wizard/) by choosing **Advanced multistep (v2)**, or generate it from the Checkout state by selecting **Complete checkout** and enabling **Generate as multistep**.

The generated layout includes Checkout steps navigation, checkout step nav items, checkout step wrappers, and next/back interactions.

## Field maintenance

Checkout v2 includes a **Sync checkout fields** control group with actions to compare generated fields with the site's current WooCommerce checkout fields:

- **Check checkout fields**
- **Generate missing fields**
- **Remove invalid fields**
- **Remove duplicate fields**

Use these after changing WooCommerce checkout fields or installing plugins that add checkout fields.

Field sync can report valid, missing, invalid, and duplicate generated fields. It can generate missing fields, remove generated fields that no longer exist in WooCommerce, remove duplicate generated fields, and update generated field labels and placeholders from the current WooCommerce field data.

The audit includes WooCommerce's `account` field section. Missing account fields are inserted into the **Checkout account fields** wrapper, while billing, shipping, and additional fields remain in their corresponding checkout sections.

Enabling **Generate account login** or **Send password setup link** does not remove the corresponding saved username or password element from an existing Checkout v2 structure. Until you run field sync, an element that WooCommerce no longer registers can still render as an optional field, but WooCommerce does not process its value because it generates that credential. Run **Check checkout fields**, then **Remove invalid fields**.

Checkout structures created with a Bricks 2.4 beta may contain a standalone **Create account** checkbox or may not contain the account wrapper. Regenerate the checkout structure or use the field sync actions after updating. Bricks creates the wrapper when missing account fields are generated and removes an obsolete standalone checkbox after the replacement wrapper and checkbox exist.

## Query loops, dynamic tags, and interactions

Checkout v2 supports WooCommerce v2 query loops for applied coupons, fees, taxes, order items, order totals, order downloads, and customer notes.

It also adds checkout/order tags such as `{woo_checkout_current_step_number}`, `{woo_order_number}`, `{woo_order_total}`, `{woo_order_item_count}`, and `{woo_order_total_with_item_count}`.

For multistep checkout layouts, use the **Checkout step** interaction action to move to the next step, previous step, a specific step, or a specific checkout field.

See [WooCommerce v2 query loops and dynamic tags](/integrations/woocommerce/woocommerce-v2-query-loops-dynamic-tags/) for the complete reference.

## Usage tips

- Use [WooCommerce advanced modular elements](/integrations/woocommerce/advanced-modular-elements/) or the [Woo Setup Wizard](/integrations/woocommerce/woo-setup-wizard/) to create the recommended Checkout v2 structure.
- Design every checkout state that customers can reach, especially Pay, Thank you, Order receipt, and Login required.
- Use the classic [Checkout template workflow](/integrations/woocommerce/checkout/) if you prefer separate checkout templates.
