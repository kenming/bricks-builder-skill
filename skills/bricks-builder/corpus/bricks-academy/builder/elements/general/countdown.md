The Countdown element displays a countdown timer to a specified date with customizable fields and actions.

## Settings

- **Date** (datepicker) - The target date and time for the countdown.

- **Time zone** (select) - The time zone for the countdown calculation. Options include various UTC offsets. Default: UTC+00:00.

- **Date Reached** (select) - Action when the countdown reaches zero. Options: `countdown` (show countdown), `hide` (hide element), `text` (show custom text). Default: `countdown`.

- **Date Reached: Custom text** (text) - Custom text to display when the date is reached. Only shown when "Date Reached" is set to "text".

### Fields

- **Fields** (repeater) - Configure the countdown display fields. Each field has:
  - **Prefix** (text) - Text before the field value.
  - **Format** (text) - Format string using %D (days), %H (hours), %M (minutes), %S (seconds). Lowercase removes leading zeros. Default: "%D days", "%H hours", "%M minutes", "%S seconds".
  - **Suffix** (text) - Text after the field value.

- **Direction** (direction) - Flex direction for the fields container.

- **Align main axis** (justify-content) - Justify content alignment for fields.

- **Align cross axis** (align-items) - Align items for fields.

### Field

- **Direction** (direction) - Flex direction for individual fields.

- **Margin** (spacing) - Margin around individual fields. Default: 0 5px 0 0.

## Dynamic target dates

The Date control accepts a date returned by dynamic data. Bricks supports common date strings such as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, `YYYY-MM-DD`, and ISO 8601, plus Unix timestamps in seconds or milliseconds.

The dynamic tag must resolve to a plain date or timestamp. Place the Countdown inside a query loop or template to let each post or product resolve its own target date.

For a WooCommerce sale countdown, use the sale end date as the target. The Countdown tracks one date, so use element conditions when it should appear only after a sale starts or while a product is on sale. Bricks does not provide dedicated WooCommerce sale start and end date tags. Store the target in a custom field or provide it through a custom dynamic tag or helper that returns one of the supported formats.
