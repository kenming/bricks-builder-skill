The **Offcanvas** element is a **nestable** panel that slides (or offsets) in from a chosen edge of the viewport. Typical use: mobile navigation. Bricks suggests adding a [Toggle](/builder/elements/general/toggle/) elsewhere on the page that targets this Offcanvas (see the in-element info link to the menu builder article).

The default structure includes an inner **Block** (`.brx-offcanvas-inner`) for your content—often with starter **Text** and a **Toggle** labeled for closing—and a second **Block** acting as the **Backdrop** (`.brx-offcanvas-backdrop`), which you can remove if you do not want a backdrop.

## Settings

- **Direction** (select) — `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`. Default: left.

- **Effect** (select) — `slide` or `offset`.

- **Close on** (select) — `backdrop` (click), `esc`, `none`, or default: backdrop and ESC.

- **Width**, **Height** (number with units) — Size of the inner panel (`.brx-offcanvas-inner`).

- **Transition: Duration** (number with units) — Open/close animation; set to `0s` to disable.

- **Transition: Timing function** (text) — Easing, e.g. `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0, 0.25, 1)`.

- **aria-label** (text) — Root dialog label; defaults to “Offcanvas”.

- **Keep open while styling** (checkbox) — Builder helper class `brx-open` to keep the panel open while designing.

- **No scroll (body)** (checkbox) — Prevents body scrolling while open.

- **Scroll to top** (checkbox) — Scrolls to top when the Offcanvas opens.

- **Disable auto focus** (checkbox) — Skips auto-focusing the first focusable element when opening.

- **Open on page load** (checkbox) — Opens on the front end when the page loads (not applied in the builder).
