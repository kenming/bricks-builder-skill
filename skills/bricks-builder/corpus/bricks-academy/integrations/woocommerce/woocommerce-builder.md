WooCommerce is a free plugin to manage the e-commerce functionality of your WordPress site. It is the world's most popular open-source solution to create and manage a shop on the Internet, and therefore Bricks proudly integrates with it.

Bricks introduces the new in-theme WooCommerce Builder, which allows you to build your entire store with it. Including the main shop page, single product page, products archives, cart, checkout, and account pages.

To design these layouts, Bricks offers WooCommerce-specific elements and template types.

Starting in Bricks 2.4, Cart, Checkout, and My Account can also use the [advanced modular workflow](/integrations/woocommerce/advanced-modular-elements/). This workflow lets you edit multiple WooCommerce page states directly on the assigned WooCommerce page with Cart v2, Checkout v2, and Account Page v2.

Use the [Woo Setup Wizard](/integrations/woocommerce/woo-setup-wizard/) to review the current WooCommerce setup and create or repair classic and v2 WooCommerce layouts from guided presets.

Certain elements only show when editing a specific template type.

The `Checkout customer details` element, for example, is only available when editing the `WooCommerce Checkout` template.

## Getting Started {#start}

To access the WooCommerce Builder in Bricks, install and activate the free WooCommerce plugin available in the official [WordPress repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) or through your WordPress dashboard under `Plugins → Add New`.

After activation, you might want to set up the store using the in-site configuration wizard or do it manually through the WooCommerce settings menus.

Please note that during the configuration wizard, you won't need to pick up a new theme because Bricks is already a theme and fully supports WooCommerce.

With the configuration done and after adding some products, you can start visually building your WooCommerce layouts with Bricks.

## WooCommerce Templates {#templates}

With WooCommerce activated, you can visually create and style the following WooCommerce templates in Bricks:

:::note
These template types are the classic WooCommerce Builder workflow. If advanced modular elements are enabled, Cart, Checkout, and My Account can instead be set up with v2 elements directly on their assigned WooCommerce pages.
:::

Use the [WooCommerce advanced modular elements](/integrations/woocommerce/advanced-modular-elements/) workflow when you want Cart, Checkout, and My Account states in one editable page instead of separate templates. The classic template workflow remains supported for existing stores and for projects that prefer separate template parts.

| **Template Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Single product** | Individual product page. |
| **Product archive** | Archive pages like product categories, tags, attributes, etc. Set visibility via Template Conditions. |
| **Cart** | The cart (when it contains products). |
| **Empty cart** | The empty cart (when it doesn't contain any products). |

## My Account builder

Starting at Bricks 1.9, you can also visually design your Account page. Including the login/registration, lost & reset password pages.

For account-specific template behavior, see [WooCommerce Account Builder](/integrations/woocommerce/woocommerce-account-builder/).

## Shop page {#shop-page}

The shop page is a special WooCommerce page which is defined as the archive page for your products.

To design a unique Shop page layout, you can directly edit the Shop page with Bricks.

Or you could add a template condition in your `WooCommerce - Product Archive` template so this template is used for the Shop page as well. Since shop page is the archive for the product post type, just set it like this.

## WooCommerce elements {#elements}

Bricks aims to provide the most flexible approach to the visual design of the WooCommerce templates without losing the functionality & hooks WooCommerce already provides that many third-party WooCommerce plugins/extensions rely upon.

Among the general WooCommerce elements and Products element, Bricks has special elements for specific WooCommerce template types like the cart or the checkout.

More than 30 WooCommerce-specific elements in total are available to design your WooCommerce templates & pages with Bricks.

![](imgs/bricks-woocommerce-elements-75700a226b.gif)

These are some of the WooCommerce-specific elements:

- Add to cart
- Product title
- Product gallery
- Product price
- Product stock
- Product meta
- Product rating
- Product reviews
- Product content
- Product short description
- Product additional information
- Product tabs
- Product up/cross-sells
- Related products

## Dynamic Data {#dynamic-data}

The WooCommerce integration adds new [dynamic data tags](/builder/dynamic-content/dynamic-data/#:~:text=Bricks%201.4%20introduces,support%20double%20quotes) to target product and [order properties](/integrations/woocommerce/checkout/#order-receipt-template).

Bricks 2.4 also adds v2 WooCommerce tags for cart totals, checkout steps, WooCommerce URLs, account addresses, order data, downloads, and customer notes. See the full [WooCommerce v2 query loops and dynamic tags](/integrations/woocommerce/woocommerce-v2-query-loops-dynamic-tags/) reference.

- Checkout step data and WooCommerce page/endpoint URLs.
- Account addresses and account edit-address state data.
- Order details, order items, order totals, order actions, downloads, and customer notes.

Most of these tags depend on a v2 page state or query loop context. For example, `{woo_order_item_title}` belongs inside a `wooOrderItems` loop, while `{woo_cart_applied_coupon}` belongs inside a `wooCartCoupons` loop.
