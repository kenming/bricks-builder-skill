Bricks 1.8.1+ integrates with the [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) (WordPress Command Line Interface). Allowing you to perform specific tasks from your server's command line interface instead of the GUI (Graphical User Interface).

### Regenerates CSS Files

Requires the Bricks "CSS loading method" to be set to "external files".

`wp bricks regenerate_assets`
