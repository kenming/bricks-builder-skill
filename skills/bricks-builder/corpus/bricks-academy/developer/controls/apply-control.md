The `apply` control saves your settings. You can set the `reload` control property to **true** in order to trigger a builder reload after the "Apply" button has been clicked. We use it in the builder for settings like the template "Populate Content" or the "SEO" page settings.

```php
$this->controls['apply'] = [
  'group' => 'template-preview',
  'type' => 'apply',
  'reload' => true,
  'label' => esc_html__( 'Apply preview', 'bricks' ),
];
```
